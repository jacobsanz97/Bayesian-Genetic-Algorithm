    "As their name suggests, genetic algorithms borrow characteristics from the concepts of biological evolution and natural selection to solve problems. They are based on the fundamental idea of having a population composed of randomly generated programs attempting to solve the given problem, and each program receiving a score for how it performed. The programs with the highest scores will have their “genetic information” combined, resulting in a new generation of programs, better suited to solving the challenge at hand than their parents. The “genetics” of the best performers of the new generation are combined, and so forth iteratively, with mutations sporadically occurring, until a solution is reached. This way the algorithm essentially learns to search for the solution to a problem all by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this project is to further improve upon the traditional framework of a Genetic Algorithm by introducing Bayesian Statistics to optimize the evolutive process. We take advantage of the information gained in the previous generation to generate better offspring by making use of Bayes theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of programs from their prior distribution and likelihood function. These are calculated based on the fitness for each individual in the population. We also accelerate evolution by actively selecting the best individuals to pass on their genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is partially based on a number of ideas presented in the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zhang, Byong-Tak. (2000). Bayesian Methods for Efficient Genetic Programming. Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines. 1. 217-242. 10.1023/A:1010010230007*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted, however, that the selection mechanism proposed in the paper of replacing a non-selected individual with the array-position individual from the past generation didn't allow this particular Genetic Algorithm to converge. Instead I opted for replacing this selection mechanism with max-pooling, which consists of replacing non-selected individuals with individuals from the top 3% of the population. In this way the use of bayesian statistics consists of comparing the posterior distribution of the current and previous generation to know when to employ max pooling."

    "As can be seen from the output of the code above, using bayesian statistics to select the population members which pass on their chromosomes in a genetic algorithm is beneficial to the convergence time of the algorithm. The Bayesian version of the genetic algorithm outperforms the traditional version by using the information gained in the previous generations to generate better offspring, and to determine when individuals needs replacement through max-pooling. Both the number of generations taken to reach the solution and the processor time taken to run the algorithm are reduced by using these modifications."
